Botanical gardens and biological collections play an important role in biodiversity conservation, scientific research, education, public engagement, and the connection between people and plants. Reliable data management is essential to making accurate information available to society. This case study focuses on creating a database with current scientific evidence on medicinal species cultivated in the Thematic Collection of Medicinal Plants (TCMP) of the Rio de Janeiro Botanical Garden, based on a bibliographic survey.

To create the database, an extensive bibliographic review was carried out between 2021 and 2023, based on consults to the Scopus, PubMed, and Google Scholar databases, using the scientific names of the CTPM plants associated with the terms "ethnopharmacology" and "medicinal uses". Articles that mentioned the medicinal potential of the species were included, excluding studies with animal testing, isolation of substances, or carcinogenic activities. Information on the medicinal potential and the part used by the plant was extracted from the selected articles and organized using the GRIST tool (https://www.getgrist.com/). The medicinal potentials of the species were classified into 15 disease or system categories according to Gras *et al*. (2021), which in turn was based on the categories in the *Economic Botany Data Collection Standard* by Cook (1995). However, it was necessary to include the categories “Food” and “Invertebrate poison” to contemplate food potentials and larvicidal indications found in the bibliographic survey.

As a result of this study, the Rio de Janeiro Botanical Garden now has a database with approximately 750 bibliographic references (1975-2023) referring to the 170 medicinal species cultivated at the Thematic Collection of Medicinal Plants. We emphasize that the GRIST tool ensures the organization, reliability, and security of the data, and facilitates access to the information.
