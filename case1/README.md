This case study aims to organize and systematize data on medicinal and food plants in Brazil, based on historical bibliographical references from the 17th and 19th centuries. The research seeks to understand the traditional uses of these plants and provide relevant information for the preservation of ancestral knowledge.

The study methodology consists of collecting and systematizing data on plants found in historical works, such as *Historia Naturalis Brasiliae* (HNB), by Piso and Marcgrave, and *Systema Materiae Medicae Vegetabilis Brasiliensis*, by Karl F.P. von Martius, in addition to other relevant works, such as the article *Plant Knowledge in the Historia Naturalis Brasiliae (1648): Retentions of Seventeenth-Century Plant Use in Brazil* (Alcantara-Rodriguez et al., 2019) and the book *Plantas Usadas Pelos Brasileiros e Suas Substâncias Medicinais* (Martius, 2023).

he data collected includes the popular name, scientific name, “origin” of the popular name, and uses of the plant (part used, purpose, form of use, users, and place of use). All information is organized in tables on the GRIST online platform (https://www.getgrist.com/), allowing the analysis of the dissemination of knowledge about plants over time and the identification of uses in different regions of Brazil.

This study is expected to enrich the field of historical ethnobotany by enabling an in-depth analysis of the evolution of the use of medicinal and food plants in the 17th and 19th centuries. By organizing and making these data available in an accessible way, the case study aims to contribute to the appreciation and conservation of traditional knowledge associated with the use of plants in Brazil, providing relevant information for researchers, health professionals, and local communities.
