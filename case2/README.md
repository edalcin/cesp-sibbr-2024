This case study aims to document and analyze traditional knowledge related to the use of plants by communities in the Lagos Region (RJ), focusing on valuing sociobiodiversity and strengthening community participation in the management of the restinga (sandbank) environment. To this end, we interviewed individuals belonging to traditional communities who possess knowledge of food and medicinal uses of local vegetation, prioritizing native individuals and residents of the municipalities of Arraial do Cabo, Armação dos Búzios, and Saquarema — localities that encompass significant areas of restinga on the Rio de Janeiro coast.

This region features, in particular, the Restinga of Massambaba, an area of high ecological and floristic importance, recognized as one of the 14 hotspots of plant diversity in Brazil, home to the Cabo Frio Plant Diversity Center (Araujo 1997). However, local sociobiodiversity is under threat due to several factors, such as intense real estate speculation, illegal burning, the introduction of invasive alien species, mass tourism, and the large influx of immigrants.

In this regard, fieldwork is being conducted in three communities: the artisanal fishing community of Arraial do Cabo, the Quilombola community of Baía Formosa in Armação dos Búzios, and the smallholders of Saquarema. These communities face significant socioenvironmental challenges, such as those affecting their traditional ways of life due to urbanization and industrialization. These changes impact the dynamics of knowledge transmission, resulting in the possible loss of traditional knowledge related to the use of plants found in the restinga.

The methodology of this study involves interviews, plant records and testimonies, and data analysis, aiming to preserve cultural memory, promote the sustainable use of resources, and inspire other conservation initiatives.
