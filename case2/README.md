The case study on the traditional knowledge of the Massambaba Restinga communities seeks to document and analyze the use of plants by local communities, with the aim of valuing sociobiodiversity and strengthening the participation of communities in the management of the restinga.

To this end, people from traditional communities who have knowledge about the food and medicinal uses of local vegetation were selected and interviewed, prioritizing native individuals and residents of the municipalities of Arraial do Cabo, Armação dos Búzios and Saquarema, which encompass the Massambaba restinga, in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

The Massambaba restinga is an area of ecological and floristic importance, being recognized as one of the 14 hotspots of plant diversity in Brazil, housing the Cabo Frio Plant Diversity Center (Araujo 1997). However, local sociobiodiversity is under threat due to several factors, such as intense real estate speculation, illegal burning, the introduction of invasive exotic species, mass tourism and the large influx of immigrants. In this sense, fieldwork has been carried out in three communities in the Massambaba restinga: the artisanal fishing community of Arraial do Cabo, the Quilombola community of Baía Formosa in Armação dos Búzios and the smallholders of Saquarema. These communities face significant socio-environmental challenges, such as those in their traditional ways of life due to urbanization and industrialization. These changes impact the dynamics of knowledge transmission, resulting in possible losses of traditional knowledge related to the use of plants found in the restinga.

The methodology of this study involves interviews, records about the plants and testimonies, and data analysis, aiming to preserve cultural memory, promote the sustainable use of resources and inspire other conservation initiatives.
