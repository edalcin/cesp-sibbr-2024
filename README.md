# Developing a Data Extension for Documenting Socio-Biodiversity Information

## Project Duration

Dec 2024 - Mar 2026

## Project overall objective

This project aims to create a data standard extension to organize socio-biodiversity data, encompassing scientific and vernacular species names along with their uses. The initiative includes developing a comprehensive dictionary of uses and controlled vocabularies, which will undergo validation through three specific case studies.

## Expected outcomes

The expected outcomes of the research include a well-documented proposal for a standard set of terms and associated vocabularies to facilitate the understanding and sharing of socio-biodiversity data. These terms will be evaluated and tested in 3 case studies, realistic and applicable examples where such information is found: 

1. gathering information on use from historical references; 
2. a practical study on traditional knowledge by fishing communities; 
3. systematizing data from databases containing information on use of species. 

These case studies will validate the initial proposal of associated and controlled terms and vocabularies. This data provides a solid foundation for the development of public policies focused on biodiversity conservation and sustainable management of natural resources. This recognition is a first step towards ensuring sovereignty, informed use of data and information related to traditional knowledge and strengthening the vision of the local communities.

## Project Description

Data and information related to traditional knowledge associated with genetic resources is often published and disseminated without adequate adherence to standards, leading to various ethical and legal issues. The years 2024 and 2025 are crucial for adopting best practices in generating, structuring, publishing, and utilizing data, particularly concerning traditional knowledge. In Brazil, as well as in other countries such as Colombia and Argentina, there is growing recognition of the importance of handling this data with utmost care to respect and protect the rights of the communities that preserve this knowledge. The CARE Principles are essential in this regard. It is expected that standardizing socio-biodiversity data can contribute to the interoperability of diverse databases, enabling the identification of information on the existence of certain traditional knowledge, including its origin, thereby supporting benefit-sharing policies, or even preventing the misuse of associated traditional knowledge of genetic resources. The establishment of interoperable databases is crucial for South American countries, which harbor some of the world's richest biological diversity. Interoperability will ensure that the origins of traditional knowledge linked to specific species/genetic resources are accurately documented. This approach guarantees that end users of these databases acknowledge the existence and origins of associated traditional knowledge. Collaborating with regional countries and other interested parties to propose interoperable database formats is highly significant. Such initiatives will facilitate the recognition of traditional peoples and communities as custodians of this invaluable knowledge. The project involves a workshop and three case studies to rigorously test and validate decisions, ensuring a robust process. To conclude, the project will have a great impact on the GBIF community when it comes to disseminating socio-biodiversity data.
